    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Fried chicken is a dish consisting of chicken pieces usually from broiler
      chickens which have been floured or battered and then pan-fried, deep
      fried, or pressure fried.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 whole chicken, cut into pieces</li>
      <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1 egg</li>
      <li>1 cup milk</li>
      <li>1 quart vegetable oil for frying</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees
        C).
      </li>
      <li>
        In a medium bowl, combine the flour, paprika, cayenne pepper, salt and
        pepper. Mix thoroughly.
      </li>
      <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together the egg and milk.</li>
      <li>
        Dip each piece of chicken in the egg mixture, and then roll in the flour
        blend. Repeat so that each piece of chicken is double coated.
      </li>
      <li>
        Deep fry in the hot oil until the crust is golden brown, and the juices
        run clear, about 10 minutes.

      <li>Drain on paper towels.</li>
